Big Picture:
  1. Greet the player and provide some instructions
  2. Once the player starts the game, a random image will be selected and displayed on screen.
  3. There will be an area for the player to make a guess of who the player is
  4. After the user submits an answer the next image will be displayed
  5. This will be repeated until all images have been displayed or time runs out 



Refinement:
  1. Browser page loads and displays a welcome message to the player
      -Also will display a brief outline of instructions, explaining how the game works.
      -The player can set a timer for how long they want to play for.
  2. Randomly select an image
      -(Not sure yet how/where to pull from).
  3. The image of the player will then be displayed to the player
      -Leave the image up until the player makes a guess
  4. Player will be prompted to make a guess
  5. Once the player makes a guess:
      -Determine whether the guess is true or false
          -if true, add 1 to the player total score
          -if false, players score will remain at whatever the current and/or previous value was
  6. After the player has submitted an answer, proceed to the next randomly selected image.
  7. Repeat this process until...
      -Either the player runs out of their set amount of time
      -Or the player makes a guess for all of the possible images within the pool.
  8. Display a message to the user when either of those outcomes happen
      -Return the players final score
      -Maybe also could return the players previous 'high score'
  9. Log the players final score 
  10. Show all the correct answers for the images that were displayed
  11. Ask if the player wants to play again.
      -If the player selects 'yes', then go back to #2 and repeat.



Assertions:
  -The players names will have to be tied to a respective image and the answer given will be taken into account as true or false
Conditionals:
  -For if statement for when the player is playing, the game will continue if the player has not exceeded the alotted time or has gone through all the images.
  -if else statement to determine whether the players guess is true or false. 
Loops:
  -
Functions:
  -Will need a function that will display the image to the player and prompt for a response
